This repository contains the coding challenge for candidates applying for an Android role at Adyen.

Your task is to implement a small app using the Foursquare Places API that shows a list of venues around the userâ€™s location.
Decide yourself which venue details should be relevant to the user. You have full freedom on how to present data on screen.
We've already added some code to make it a bit easier for you, but you are free to change any part of it.
We are going to check your implementation for understanding Android specifics (like handling configuration changes), UX choices, and overall architecture.
You are free to add any feature or code you want, but we also value quality over quantity, so whatever you decide to do, try to show us your best.

## Setup
Add your Foursquare client ID and secret to `local.gradle`. See `local.gradle.example` for details.
Tip: You can verify your credentials with `src/test/java/com/adyen/android/assignment/PlacesUnitTest.kt`

Minimal requirements:
- Implement permission handling
- Show a list of venues based on the current location
- Apply best practices to handle configuration changes
